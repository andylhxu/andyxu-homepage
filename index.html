    <p>I'm particularly interested in hardware-software interface, IoT and Cluster Computing. Asking my hobby? Various, guitar, badminton, anime...</p>
    <p>I like traveling. Althought I haven't been to that many countries, I do a lot of commentaries on things I like. You can checkout my <strong>Foursquare</strong> profile from below.</p>

    <dl class="question-list">
	<dt class="question">What is your favourite planet in the Solar System?</dt>
	<dt class="answer">Mimas, a satalite of Saturn. It was discovered later that it surprisingly looks like Death Star after the first movie the New Hope was released, just out of coincidence.</dt>
        <dt class="question">What's the best place you can get Ramen on Manhattan?</dt>
        <dd class="answer">Now you asked the <strong>right person</strong> for the right question. In fact, there's a huge controversy among New Yorkers about which restaurant should top the list. Typically I would say <strong>Toto Ramen</strong> and <strong>Ippudo New York</strong> should mark the top of the list both in Yelp and Foursquare. However, personally I have more attachment to the latter.</dd>
